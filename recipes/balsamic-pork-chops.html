    <p><i>Jazz up your weeknight pan-fried pork chops with a balsamic glaze! We like these with steamed broccoli and a crispy, fresh salad.</i></p>
    <p>Seared to perfection with a gorgeous thick golden crust, and served with a balsamic glaze that is tangy and sweet – but not too sweet.
    The balsamic reduction in this recipe is a great one to add to your arsenal because it is a secret weapon for wickedly delicious super fast meals (GREAT with chicken!). Use as a drizzle to fancy things up – just like restaurants do!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 (5 ounce) bone-in pork chops, 3/4-inch thick</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 cup chicken broth</li>
        <li>¼ cup good quality balsamic vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon honey</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Pat pork chops dry with paper towels, and season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a large, nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add olive oil and stir to combine.</li>
        <li>When butter and oil shimmer, carefully add chops and cook over medium heat until browned on one side, 5 to 6 minutes. Turn and cook pork chops until no longer pink in the center and browned on the other side, 3 to 4 minutes. Do not overcook the chops or they will turn dry and hard. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Remove pork chops from heat and cover to keep warm.</li>
        <li>Combine chicken broth, balsamic vinegar, and honey in a small saucepan. Bring glaze to a boil over medium-high heat and boil until mixture is reduced to 1/2 cup, 5 to 6 minutes.</li>
        <li>Drizzle pan-fried chops with balsamic glaze and serve warm.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Cook's Note:</h3>
    <p>Vary the flavor of the glaze by adding 1 minced garlic clove, or a sprig of rosemary. Remove rosemary before serving.</p>
